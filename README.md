# Corporate Identity
Here we manage the most important assets for the OMG (Open Marketplace Applications) Project.

## Font
We use Open Sans as a font. You can download the the whole font from fonts.google.com or just use the one from here. We are only using two font-weight's, ```400``` for paragraphs and ```800``` for headings. You can just copy the styles from the ```font.css``` file to get started.

## Colors
You can get the HEX and RGB colors from the ```colors.css``` file.

## Logo
In the logo folder you can find the logo itself as well as only the symbol. You can get both as ```.jpg```, ```.png```, ```.svg```, ```.pdf``` or as original file ```.ai```.

## Adobe XD File
Here you can find the Corporate Identity XD File as well as the Mockups for the Mobile Application.
